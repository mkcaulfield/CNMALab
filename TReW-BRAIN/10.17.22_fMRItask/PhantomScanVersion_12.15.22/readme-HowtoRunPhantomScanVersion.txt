For running the "Phantom Scanner" version of the script:

Run it from within this directory, where I have changed the "correct" column in the SART files to have a 'None' (for no-go trials) or a '2' (for go-trials).

To simulate 9 scanner pulses (this is what was suggested by the guy who described how to do it, to give the scanner time to warm up instead of just jumping right in), hit the equals sign 9 times in a row at the beginning.

For thought probes, to move right and left, hit 2 and 3 on a keyboard or right index and right middle fingers on the glove, and to lock in your response hit 1 on a keyboard or use your right thumb on the glove.
